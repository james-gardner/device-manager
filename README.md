Device Manager
==============

Sample application for learning.

**Imaginary Problem Description**

We have a drawer full of devices which our developers are using to test the product.

Devices aren't being returned to the drawer and as our team grows larger it's becoming
harder to track down who has a device. Devices are also not always charged before
being returned.

Our office manager introduced a spreadsheet for signing each time a device is removed but 
given the size of our team it's the size of an A3 sheet of paper and the cells are too small
to write in.

**Solution**

Create an application that can provide information on the whereabouts and status of a device.

The application should at the very least:

  * Catalog and list all of our devices (you can fake these using data.js or your own dummy data)
  * Reflect the status (availability, last user etc) of each device
  * Allow you to change/toggle the status

**Constraints**

  * Must be browser based
  * Must be written in pure JavaScript (no coffeescript!)
  * Try and avoid the use of jQuery and other such libraries (you can assume ES5) We will be looking at framework and refactoring at a later state.
  * Must work on IE10+

**Additional Details and Resources**
  * No need to persist changes to data.
  * Submit your proposals/code via pull requests. Questions via issues.
  * Styles/Appearance are not important. Purely focussed on functionality.
